# What are these notes?
Hello, I am Gauri Bhardwaj, and these are my working notes and essays. I write essays about my experimentation progress, video games, and other topics that I am yet to learn about. Some of these posts are a work in progress and are updated as I learn more about that topic. 
The idea behind these notes is to provide a guidebook for my future self's brain, and as a memoir of all the knowledge rabbit holes I have jumped in. 

If you are more interested in my past projects and credentials, you can view them in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E5tnEaHH0VQCc6aoAQUmvI31BBWA-Yss/view?usp=sharing)
